# Algorithm Analysis and Design Assignment Report

## Introduction
This report presents the analysis and empirical evaluation of algorithms for powering a number and finding pairs with a given sum in a set. It emphasizes the application of the naive iterative method, divide-and-conquer strategy, merge sort, and binary search algorithms.

## Methodology
The study involves the following steps:
1. Implementation of naive and divide-and-conquer methods for powering a number.
2. Implementation of merge sort and binary search algorithms to find pairs with a given sum.
3. Theoretical analysis of time complexities.
4. Empirical testing to observe scalability and performance.

## Results and Discussion
### Powering a Number
- The naive method's running time grows linearly with the size of the exponent, reflecting its \( O(n) \) complexity.
- The divide-and-conquer method exhibits sub-linear growth, indicative of its \( O(\log n) \) complexity.

### Finding Pairs with a Given Sum
- The combined algorithm leverages merge sort (\( O(n \log n) \)) and binary search (\( O(\log n) \)).
- Empirical tests demonstrate a growth pattern consistent with theoretical expectations.

### Comparative Analysis
- Empirical results are aligned with the theoretical complexities, validating the analyses.
- Divide-and-conquer algorithms demonstrate superior scalability and efficiency compared to naive approaches.

## Conclusion
The study confirms the theoretical complexities through empirical tests, underscoring the effectiveness of divide-and-conquer algorithms. It highlights the significance of algorithmic analysis in predicting performance and guiding efficient problem-solving.
